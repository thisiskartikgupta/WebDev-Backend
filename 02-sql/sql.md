    ADDRESS CHAR(50),
    SALARY REAL
);
```

## Create a schema

```sql
CREATE SCHEMA testschema;

CREATE TABLE testschema.finance(
    ...
);

DROP SCHEMA testschema CASCADE;

```

## INSERT in SQL

SELECT * FROM COMPANY WHERE AGE >= 25 AND SALARY < 100000;

SELECT * FROM COMPANY WHERE SALARY IS NOT NULL;

SELECT * FROM COMPANY WHERE NAME LIKE 'A%';

SELECT * FROM COMPANY WHERE NAME LIKE '_A_V%';

SELECT * FROM COMPANY WHERE SALARY::TEXT LIKE '269%';

```sql

CREATE TABLE customers(
   customer_id INT GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY,
   customer_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
   PRIMARY KEY(customer_id)
);

CREATE TABLE contacts(
   contact_id INT GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY,
   customer_id INT,
   contact_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
   phone VARCHAR(15),
   email VARCHAR(100),
   PRIMARY KEY(contact_id),
   CONSTRAINT fk_customer
      FOREIGN KEY(customer_id)
	  REFERENCES customers(customer_id)
	  ON DELETE CASCADE
